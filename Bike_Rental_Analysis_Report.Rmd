# 1. Introduction 
The rapid urbanisation of recent decades has seen cities face challenges such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and limited parking spaces. In the face of these issues, rental bike systems have gained significant popularity, offering a cheap and eco-friendly alternative to more traditional commuting methods. Rental bikes provide a practical solution for short-distance travel, be it for students going to school, office workers heading to the workplace and even tourists exploring a city. In addition to promoting an active lifestyle, they eliminate the hassle of bike ownership, such as storage and maintenance. The growing demand of rental bike companies is reflected in the global market value of bike rentals, projected to reach a value of $11.3 billion in 2031, marking a 538% increase from the 2021 market value of $2.1 billion (Allied Market Research, 2021).
	The biggest challenge rental bike companies face is ensuring constant availability of bikes, as demand can fluctuate due to  numerous reasons. Bikes must be readily accessible to users at all times, making it essential for company leaders to be aware of peak hours, the impact of weather conditions and high-demand areas. In this project, we will use various machine learning models to predict the number of rented bikes required to meet customer demand under different circumstances. The goal is to assist a fictional bike rental company operating in Seoul, South Korea, in planning the optimal size of their bike fleet.

# Dataset „Seoul Bike Sharing Demand“
To conduct our analysis, we will use a dataset which contains the count of public bicycles rented per hour in the Seoul Bike Sharing System with corresponding weather data and holiday information, collected between 2017 and 2018 (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2020). We will enrich the dataset by adding columns that capture different times-related factors, such as whether a given day is a working day or a weekend. Additionally, we will categorise hours into specific periods to better capture daily trends in bike demand.
